    "We used the total votes trump and biden got in the 2020 elections. To calculate a new column which reflected the winner in each county, we also used the total population column which provided us with the population estimates for each county. Using these two pieces of information we could test our association rule and got the formentioned results. Our data preparation included using existing columns like \"votes20_donaldtrump\", \"votes20_joebiden\", to calcualte a new column which gave us the winner in each county based on the difference of the two columns. To check whether the county population was greater than 100,000, we used the column \"totalpop\"."

In our data, the support was not very high because biden did not win as many counties as trump did. A high cofidence shows, among the data where the assosication rule can be applied, it holds true. In our data, of all the counties biden won, 62% had a population of greater than 100,000, which is decent.  "

    "\n",
    "Ans. The value of the lift metric for our dataset and the stated association rule is 2.1, which tells us that counties with population of oven 100,000 were roughly 2 times as likely to vote go to Joe Biden as compared to Donald Trump, during the 2020 US Elections.\n",
