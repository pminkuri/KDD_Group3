## Project Introduction:
 
We will be performing Exploratory Data Analysis on the Community Mobility Reports data provided by Google during the pandemic period and analyse how the mobility of people to various popular public places has changed. We will try to extract various insights such as how the visits and duration of stay at different places changed compared to a baseline. The baseline is considered as the median value for the corresponding day of the 5- week period duration Jan 3–Feb 6, 2020.

 
## Research Question:
 
The Research Question we are focusing on is how COVID’19 has impacted the mobility of people in various public places listed below with respect to daily positive cases across different states in the United States. This analysis can help public health authorities to take effective measures such as implementing social distancing restrictions and improving access to essential services. We also analyse how the mobility has impacted in different Red and Blue states of US.
1. 	Groceries & pharmacy
2. 	Retail & recreation
